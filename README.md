# ListOperations 📋
### Description
Write a function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list containing only strings with 10 or more characters.

### Requirements
- Use List<> data structure.
- Implement the function using loop structures, without using Linq extension methods.

# StackOperations ⚖️
### Description
Write a function that takes a mathematical expression as input and checks if the expression is balanced. An expression is balanced if, for each opening parenthesis, there is a corresponding closing parenthesis.

### Requirements
- Use Stack<> data structure.
- Consider all three types of parentheses: (), {}, [].
- Implement the function using loop structures, without using Linq extension methods.
Examples
Balanced expression: (2+1)*80/(7-[√9 + {4² * 0}])
Unbalanced expression: ([{35 - 2} + 5*3} + 0 / 15) - [3 + 5³] * 11)

# QueueOperations 🎲

### Description
Write a function that simulates the game of hot potato. In this game, players pass the hot potato around a circle until it explodes. The player holding the potato when it explodes is out of the game. 🥔💥

### Requirements
- Use Queue<> data structure.
- The function should take the number of players as a parameter.
- The function should randomly select a number between 1 and 100 as the number of passes until the potato explodes.
- Each player who "survives" the potato pass should go to the end of the queue until the potato explodes.
- Implement the function using loop structures, without using Linq extension methods.

# DictOperations 📊

### Description
Using a dictionary, create a word counter program. The program should take a text as input and, using a dictionary, count the occurrences of each word in the text. 📚📊

### Requirements
- Use Dictionary<,> data structure.
- Implement the function without using Linq extension methods.
